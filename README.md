# VM-SIEM-LAB
A homemade virtual lab project consisting of a attacker and defender VM's for learning purposes

To preface - this will be a documentation project about creating a simple dual vm setup of attacker using a Kali Linux distribution located outside the defenders site. Defender will be a W11 virtual machine using a Wazuh XDR, with its own virtual network. Currently a work-in-progress - everything can be changed.
